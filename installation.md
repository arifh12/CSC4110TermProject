# Installation
## Prerequisites
In order to run this application, you must have Java and IntelliJ IDE pre-installed onto your system. Also, the application requires JDK verison 1.8 since it was developed using JavaFX, and the latest versions of JDK no longer support the JavaFX GUI toolkit. Finally, you will need the MySQL database set up on your computer.

## Building and Running
* Download and unzip the project from this GitLab repository.
* Open the project using IntelliJ IDE.
* Select JDK 1.8 in the Project Settings menu under Project SDK.
* Ensure that your MySQL database is running.
* In the DBConnection class, enter your MySQL username and password on line 52.
* Press Shift + F10 to build and run the application.

Note: This program uses the MySQL Connector .jar file, which is already included in the project repository. No further installation is required.
